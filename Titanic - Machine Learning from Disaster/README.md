## Problem Statement
Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck or not.

## Dataset
1). train.csv:- training dataset, contains all attributes required to make a predictive model along with the outcome attribute i.e. "ground truth".

2). test.csv:- testing dataset, contains all attributes except outcome.

3). gender_submission.csv:- a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.
